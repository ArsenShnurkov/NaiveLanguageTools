The weird calculator to show how patterns and disambiguation works.
a + b   : adds a and b
a - b   : subtract b from a
a < b   : binary shift left
a > b   : binary shift right
a < b > : the b-th bit of a

To make it work do the following:
* build entire solution
* run "refresh" from command line to re-generate .auto.cs files
* run the project
