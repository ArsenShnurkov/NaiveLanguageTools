I know very little about chemistry so this example might be wrong
from scientific POV. Enter formula (like H2O or (Cl2)2) and
observe how it is split into atoms.

To make it work do the following:
* build entire solution
* run "refresh" from command line to re-generate .auto.cs files
* run the project
